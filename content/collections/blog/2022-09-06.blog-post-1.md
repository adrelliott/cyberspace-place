You’ve probably done a Myers Briggs (MBTI) survey - you may even know which 4 letter combination you are.
But, how accurate is it really?
In this episode, Business Psychologist (and lead consultant at Oblong), Leanne Elliott digs into psychometric tests, and starts by asking if the MBT is as good as they say it is.
You’ll hear her draw on both her decade of recruitment & engagement, as well as explaining the science behind it all.
Let’s dive in!
